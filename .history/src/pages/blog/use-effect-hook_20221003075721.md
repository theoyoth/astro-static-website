useEffect is a React Hook that lets you synchronize a component with an external system.

## Usage

### Connecting to an external system

Sometimes, your component might need to stay connected to the network, some browser API, or a third-party library, while it is displayed on the page. Such systems aren’t controlled by React, so they are called external.
