useState is a React Hook that lets you add a state variable to your component.

## Usage

### Adding state to a component

Call useState at the top level of your component to declare one or more state variables.

```
import { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
const [age, setAge] = useState(42);
const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');
```
