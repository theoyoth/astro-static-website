useRef is a React Hook that lets you reference a value thatâ€™s not needed for rendering.

# Usage

## Referencing a value with a ref

#### Call useRef at the top level of your component to declare one or more refs.

```
import { useRef } from 'react';

function Stopwatch() {
const intervalRef = useRef(0);
// ...
```
